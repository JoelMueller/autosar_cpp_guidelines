## Rationale

Additional identifiers introduced by a using declaration makes only prior declarations
of this identifier visible. Any potential subsequent declarations will not be added to
the current scope, which may lead to unexpected results and developers confusion.
Overriding or overloading a member function in a derived class causes other member
functions with the same name to be hidden. Thus, a potential function call may result
in a different function being called depending on if the call was made using the
derived or base class reference/pointer. Introducing hidden names into the derived
class by a using declaration helps to avoid such misleading situations.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A7-3-1.cpp 312801 2018-03-21 16:17:05Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
#include <cstdint>

class Base
{
public:
void P(uint32_t);

virtual void V(uint32_t);
virtual void V(double);

};

class NonCompliant : public Base
{
public:
//hides P(uint32_t) when calling from the
//derived class
void P(double);
//hides V(uint32_t) when calling from the
//derived class
void V(double) override;
};

class Compliant : public Base
{
public:
//both P(uint32_t) and P(double) available
//from the derived class
using Base::P;
void P(double);

//both P(uint32_t) and P(double)
using Base::V;
void V(double) override;

};

void F1()
{
NonCompliant d{};
d.P(0U); // D::P (double) called
Base& b{d};
b.P(0U); // NonCompliant::P (uint32_t) called

d.V(0U); // D::V (double) called
b.V(0U); // NonCompliant::V (uint32_t) called

}

void F2()
{
Compliant d{};
d.P(0U); // Compliant::P (uint32_t) called

Base& b{d};
b.P(0U); // Compliant::P (uint32_t) called

d.V(0U); // Compliant::V (uint32_t) called
b.V(0U); // Compliant::V (uint32_t) called

}

namespace NS
{
void F(uint16_t);
}

//includes only preceding declarations into
//the current scope
using NS::F;

namespace NS
{
void F(uint32_t);
}

void B(uint32_t b)
{
//non-compliant, only F(uint16_t) is available
//in this scope
F(b);
}

```
