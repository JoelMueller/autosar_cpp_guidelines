## Rationale

A constructor of a class is supposed to completely initialize its object. Explicit
initialization of all virtual base classes, direct non-virtual base classes and non-static
data members reduces the risk of an invalid state after successful construction.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A12-1-1.cpp 271696 2017-03-23 09:23:09Z piotr.tanski $
#include <cstdint>
class Base
{
// Implementation
};
class VirtualBase
{
};
class A : public virtual VirtualBase, public Base
{
public:
A() : VirtualBase{}, Base{}, i{0}, j{0} // Compliant
{
}

A(A const& oth)
: Base{}, j{0}

//
//

Non-compliant - VirtualBase base class and member
i not initialized

{
}

private:
std::int32_t i;
std::int32_t j;
static std::int32_t k;
};
std::int32_t A::k{0};

```
