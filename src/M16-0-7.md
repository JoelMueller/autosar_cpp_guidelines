> **Rule M16-0-7 (required, implementation, automated)**
>
> Undefined macro identifiers shall not be used in #if or #elif preprocessor directives, except as operands to the defined operator.
> See MISRA C++ 2008 [7]
> Note: “#if” and “#elif” are anyway only allowed for conditional file inclusion, see A160-1. This rule is kept in case A16-0-1 is disabled in a project.
