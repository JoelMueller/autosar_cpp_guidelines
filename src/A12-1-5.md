> Common class initialization for non-constant members shall be done by

## Rationale

Common initialization of non-constant members in a delegating constructor prevents
from code repetition, accidental differences and maintenance problems.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A12-1-5.cpp 289436 2017-10-04 10:45:23Z michal.szczepankiewicz $

#include <cstdint>

class A
{
public:
// Compliant
A(std::int32_t x, std::int32_t y) : x(x + 8), y(y) {}
explicit A(std::int32_t x) : A(x, 0) {}

private:
std::int32_t x;
std::int32_t y;

};

class B
{
public:
// Non-compliant
B(std::int32_t x, std::int32_t y) : x(x + 8), y(y) {}
explicit B(std::int32_t x) : x(x + 8), y(0) {}

private:
std::int32_t x;
std::int32_t y;

};

```
