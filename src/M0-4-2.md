## Rationale

Floating-point arithmetic has a range of problems associated with it. Some of these
can be overcome by using an implementation that conforms to IEEE 754 (IEEE
Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic).
Note that the rule implies that toolchain, hardware, C++ Standard Library and C++
built-in types (i.e. float, double) will provide full compliance to IEEE 754 standard in
order to use floating-points in the project.
Also, see: A0-4-2.

## Example

```cpp
//% $Id: A0-4-1.cpp 271389 2017-03-21 14:41:05Z piotr.tanski $
#include <limits>
static_assert(
std::numeric_limits<float>::is_iec559,
"Type float does not comply with IEEE 754 single precision format");
static_assert(

std::numeric_limits<float>::digits == 24,
"Type float does not comply with IEEE 754 single precision format");

static_assert(
std::numeric_limits<double>::is_iec559,
"type double does not comply with IEEE 754 double precision format");
static_assert(
std::numeric_limits<double>::digits == 53,
"Type double does not comply with IEEE 754 double precision format");

```
