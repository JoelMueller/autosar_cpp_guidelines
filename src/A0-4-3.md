## Rationale

It is important to determine whether implementations provided by the chosen
compiler strictly follow the ISO/IEC 14882:2014 C++ Language Standard.

## Example

Since the ISO/IEC 14882:2014 C++ Language Standard, the integer division and
modulo operator results are no longer implementation-defined. The sentence “if both
operands are nonnegative then the remainder is nonnegative; if not, the sign of the
remainder is implementation-defined” from ISO/IEC 14882:2003 is no longer present
in the standard since ISO/IEC 14882:2011. Note that this rule also covers the modulo
operator as it is defined in terms of integer division.
Deducing the type of an auto variable initialized using auto x{<value>} is
implemented differently depending on the language standard. In C++11 and C++14,
x will be a std::initializer_list, whereas in C++17, x will be a type deduced from the
specified <value>. Furthermore, some compilers may already implement the C++17
behavior even when operated in C++14 mode.
Note: Rule A8-5-3 forbids initializing an auto variable with the curly braces ({}) syntax.
Other features provided by the chosen compiler also should follow the ISO/IEC
