## Rationale

Placement new can be useful for cases in which allocation is required separately
from type initialization, e.g. memory allocators, generic containers. Correct usage of
placement new requires passing a pointer that:
is suitably aligned
provides sufficient storage memory
Violating above constrains will result in an object constructed at a misaligned location
or memory initialization outside of the allocated bounds, which leads to undefined
behaviour. An initial memory pointer used for placement new shall not be used after
the call.

## Example

```cpp
//% $Id: A18-5-10.cpp 305629 2018-01-29 13:29:25Z piotr.serwa $

#include <new>
#include <cstdint>

void Foo()
{
uint8_t c;
uint64_t* ptr = ::new (&c) uint64_t;

//non-compliant, insufficient storage
}

void Bar()
{
uint8_t c; // Used elsewhere in the function
uint8_t buf[sizeof(uint64_t)];
uint64_t* ptr = ::new (buf) uint64_t;

//non-compliant, storage not properly aligned
}

```

with properly aligned pointers to sufficient storage capacity
Rule A18-5-11 (required, implementation, automated) “operator
new” and “operator delete” shall be defined together.

## Rationale

Providing a custom allocation function (operator new) for a class or program implies
the use of a custom memory management scheme different to the default one. It is
therefore unlikely that memory allocated using a custom allocation function can be
deallocated by the default deallocation function (operator delete).

## Example

```cpp
//% $Id: A18-5-11.cpp 316977 2018-04-20 12:37:31Z christof.meerwald $
#include <cstdlib>

class A {
public:
static void * operator new(std::size_t s); // Compliant: operator new

static void operator delete(void *ptr);

// defined together with
// operator delete

};

class B {
public:

static void * operator new(std::size_t s);

// Non-compliant: operator

static void * operator new [](std::size_t s); // new defined without

// corresponding operator
// delete

};

```
