> Hierarchies should be based on interface classes.

## Rationale

Software design that provides common and standardized interfaces without
committing to a particular implementation:

eliminates of potential redundancy.
increases software reusability.
hides implementation details.
can be easily extended.

facilitates different objects iteration.
Well-defined interfaces are less prone to require further reworking and maintenance.
