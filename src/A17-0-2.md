> **Rule A17-0-2 (required, implementation, non-automated)**
>
> All projectâ€™s code including used libraries (including standard and userdefined libraries) and any third-party user code shall conform to the
> AUTOSAR C++14 Coding Guidelines.

## Rationale

Note that library code can be provided as source code or be provided in a compiled
form. The rule applies for any form of libraries.
As for any rule in this standard, a deviation procedure can be performed for this rule
and the project needs to argue what are the measures ensuring that non-compliant
libraries can be used in a project, addressing:
interference from the non-compliant code (for example, a library function
overwrites the stack or heap of the caller)
residual errors in non-compliant code resulting with its wrong outputs, which are
subsequently used (for example, a library function delivers wrong return value
used by the caller).

## Exception

If a function is defined in a library or any third-party user code but it is ensured that
the function will not be used (directly or indirectly) in the project, then the function
may not conform to the AUTOSAR C++14 Coding Guidelines.
