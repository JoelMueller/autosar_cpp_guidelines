> ”in” parameters for ”cheap to copy” types shall be passed by value.

## Rationale

Passing an argument by value documents that the argument won’t be modified.
Copying the value (instead of passing by reference to const) also ensures that no
indirection is needed in the function body to access the value.
For the purpose of this rule, ”cheap to copy” is defined as a trivially copyable type
that is no longer than two words (i.e. pointers).

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A8-4-7.cpp 305588 2018-01-29 11:07:35Z michal.szczepankiewicz $

#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Compliant, pass by value
void output(std::uint32_t i)
{
std::cout << i << ’\n’;
}

// Non-Compliant, std::string is not trivially copyable
void output(std::string s)
{
std::cout << s << ’\n’;
}

struct A
{
std::uint32_t v1;
std::uint32_t v2;
};

// Non-Compliant, A is trivially copyable and no longer than two words
void output(const A &a)
{
std::cout << a.v1 << ", " << a.v2 << ’\n’;
}

```
