## Rationale

Known as a DU dataflow anomaly, this is a process whereby there is a data flow in which
a variable is given a value that is not subsequently used. At best this is inefficient,
but may indicate a genuine problem. Often the presence of these constructs is due to
the wrong choice of statement aggregates such as loops.

See: DU-Anomaly.

## Exception

Loop control variables (see Section 6.6.5) are exempt from this rule.

## Example

            // but not used
    if (param > 0)

        return 1;
    }

    x = 0; // Non-compliant - DU data flow anomaly; Variable defined, but x is
           // not subsequently used and goes out of scope

            // one of the branches
            // However, scope of x variable could be reduced
    if (param > 20)

    return 0;

        1}; // Compliant - variable defined, and will be used in
            // some of the branches

    {
        return x + 1;

    else
    {
        return 0;
    }
}
void Fn5() noexcept
{
    std::array<std::int32_t, 100> arr{};
    arr.fill(1);

    constexpr std::uint8_t limit{100U};
    std::int8_t x{0};
    for (std::uint8_t i{0U}; i < limit; ++i) // Compliant by exception - on the
                                             // final loop, value of i defined will
                                             // not be used
    {
        arr[i] = arr[x];
        ++x; // Non-compliant - DU data flow anomaly on the final loop, value
             // defined and not used
    }
