## Rationale

Trigraphs are denoted to be a sequence of 2 question marks followed by a specified
third character (e.g. ??’ represents a ~character. They can cause accidental
confusion with other uses of two question marks.
The Trigraphs are: ??=, ??/, ??’, ??(, ??), ??!, ??<, ??>, ??-.

## Example

```cpp
//% $Id: A2-5-1.cpp 289436 2017-10-04 10:45:23Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
#include <iostream>
void Fn1()
{
    std::cout << "Enter date ??/??/??"; // Non-compliant, ??/??/?? becomes \\??
                                        // after trigraph translation
}

void Fn2()
{
    std::cout << "Enter date dd/mm/yy"; // Compliant
}

```
