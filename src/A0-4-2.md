## Rationale

The width of long double type, and therefore width of the significand, is
implementation-defined.
The width of long double type can be either:
64 bits, as the C++14 Language Standard allows long double to provide at least
as much precision as type double does, or
80 bits, as the IEEE 754 standard allows extended precision formats (see:
Extended-Precision-Format), or

## Example

```cpp
//% $Id: A0-4-2.cpp 289436 2017-10-04 10:45:23Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
void Fn() noexcept
{
float f1{0.1F};
// Compliant
double f2{0.1};
// Compliant
long double f3{0.1L}; // Non-compliant
}

```
