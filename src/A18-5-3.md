## Rationale

Plain and array forms of new and delete expressions must not be mixed. If an array
was allocated using a new expression, then an array delete expression must be used
to deallocate it and vice versa.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A18-5-3.cpp 316977 2018-04-20 12:37:31Z christof.meerwald $
#include <cstdint>

void Fn1()
{
std::int32_t* array =

new std::int32_t[10]; // new expression used to allocate an
// array object
// ...
delete array; // Non-compliant - array delete expression supposed
// to be used
}
void Fn2()
{
std::int32_t* object = new std::int32_t{0}; // new operator used to

// allocate the
// integer type

memory for an

// ...
delete[] object; // Non-compliant - non-array delete expression supposed
// to be used
}
void Fn3()
{
std::int32_t* object = new std::int32_t{0};

std::int32_t* array = new std::int32_t[10];
// ...
delete[] array; // Compliant
delete object;
// Compliant
}

```
