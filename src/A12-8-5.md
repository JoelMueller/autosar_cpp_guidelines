## Rationale

User-defined copy assignment operator and move assignment operator need to
prevent self-assignment, so the operation will not leave the object in an indeterminate
state. If the given parameter is the same object as the local object, destroying objectlocal resources will invalidate them. It violates the copy/move assignment
postconditions.
Note that STL containers assume that self-assignment of an object is correctly handled.
Otherwise it may lead to unexpected behavior of an STL container.

Self-assignment problem can also be solved using swap operators. See rule: A12-8-2.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A12-8-5.cpp 271773 2017-03-23 13:16:53Z piotr.tanski $
#include <cstdint>
#include <stdexcept>
struct A
{
std::int32_t number;

std::int32_t* ptr;

// Implementation

};
class B
{
public:
// ...
B& operator=(B const& oth) // Non-compliant
{
i = oth.i;
delete aPtr;

try
{

aPtr = new A(*oth.aPtr); // If this is the self-copy
// the oth.a_ptr is already

case, then
deleted

}
catch (std::bad_alloc&)
{
aPtr = nullptr;
}

return *this;

}

private:
std::int16_t i = 0;
A* aPtr = nullptr;

};
class C
{
public:
C& operator=(C const& oth) // Compliant
{
if (this != &oth)
{
A* tmpPtr = new A(*oth.aPtr);

i = oth.i;
delete aPtr;
aPtr = tmpPtr;

}

return *this;
}
C& operator=(C&& oth) // Compliant
{
if (this != &oth)
{

A* tmpPtr = new A{std::move(*oth.aPtr)};

i = oth.i;
delete aPtr;
aPtr = tmpPtr;

}

return *this;

}

private:
std::int16_t i = 0;

A* aPtr = nullptr;

};

```
