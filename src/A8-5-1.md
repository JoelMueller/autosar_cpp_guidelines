## Rationale

To avoid confusion and possible use of uninitialized data members, it is
recommended that the initialization list matches the actual initialization order.
Regardless of the order of member initializers in a initialization list, the order of
initialization is always:
Virtual base classes in depth and left to right order of the inheritance graph.
Direct non-virtual base classes in left to right order of inheritance list.

Non-static member data in order of declaration in the class definition.
Note that “The order of derivation is relevant only to determine the order of default
initialization by constructors and cleanup by destructors.” [C++14 Language Standard
[3]]

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A8-5-1.cpp 271696 2017-03-23 09:23:09Z piotr.tanski $
#include <cstdint>
#include <string>
class A
{

};
class B
{
};
class C : public virtual B, public A
{
public:
C() : B(), A(), s() {} // Compliant

// C() : A(), B() { } // Non-compliant - incorrect order of initialization

private:
std::string s;

};
class D
{
};
class E
{
};
class F : public virtual A, public B, public virtual D, public E
{
public:
F() : A(), D(), B(), E(), number1(0), number2(0U) {} // Compliant
F(F const& oth)
: B(), E(), A(), D(), number1(oth.number1), number2(oth.number2)
{
} // Non-compliant - incorrect
// order of initialization

private:
std::int32_t number1;
std::uint8_t number2;

};

```
