> **Rule A12-8-4 (required, implementation, automated)**
>
> Move constructor shall not initialize its class members and base
> classes using copy semantics.

## Rationale

Data members or base classes initialization in move constructor needs to be done
with move semantics. Move construction is an optimization strategy and the copyinitialization for data members and base classes will have negative impact on the
programâ€™s performance, as well as it does not meet developer expectations.

## Exception

In move constructor, copy initialization for data members of scalar types does not
violate this rule.
See: Scalar-Types.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A12-8-4.cpp 271696 2017-03-23 09:23:09Z piotr.tanski $
#include <cstdint>
#include <string>
class A
{
public:
// ...
A(A&& oth)
: x(std::move(oth.x)),
// Compliant
s(std::move(oth.s))
// Compliant
{
}

private:
std::int32_t x;
std::string s;

};

class B
{
public:
// ...
B(B&& oth)
: x(oth.x),

s(oth.s)

// Compliant by exception, std::int32_t is of scalar
// type
// Non-compliant

{
}

private:
std::int32_t x;
std::string s;

};
class C
{
public:
// ...
C(C&& oth)
: x(oth.x),
s(std::move(oth.s))
{
}

// Compliant
// Compliant

by exception

private:
std::int32_t x = 0;
std::string s = "Default string";

};

```
