> Enumerations should be used to represent sets of related named constants.

## Rationale

Explicit declaration of constants as an enumeration clearly shows that they are
related, which enhances readability and maintenance.
Note: Using switch statement on an enumeration is a common case and such an
approach helps to detect errors, see M6-4-6.

## Example

```cpp
//% $Id: A7-2-5.cpp 305629 2018-01-29 13:29:25Z piotr.serwa $
#include <cstdint>
//compliant
enum class WebpageColors: std::uint32_t
{
Red,
Blue,
Green
};
//non-compliant
enum class Misc: std::uint32_t
{
Yellow,
Monday,
Holiday
};

```
