## Rationale

It is expected behavior that the move/copy constructors are only used to move/copy
the object of the class type and possibly set moved-from object to a valid state.
Move and copy constructors of an object are frequently called by STL algorithms and
containers, so they are not supposed to provide any performance overhead or side
effects that could affect moving or copying the object.
Note: Class members that are not essential for a class invariant may not need to be
copied (e.g. caches, debug information).

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A12-8-1.cpp 303582 2018-01-11 13:42:56Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
#include <cstdint>
#include <utility>
class A
{
public:
// Implementation
A(A const& oth) : x(oth.x) // Compliant
{
}

private:
std::int32_t x;

};
class B
{
public:
// Implementation
B(B&& oth) : ptr(std::move(oth.ptr)) // Compliant
{
oth.ptr = nullptr; // Compliant - this is not a side-effect, in this
// case it is
essential to leave moved-from object
// in a valid state, otherwise double deletion will

// occur.

}
~B() { delete ptr; }

private:

std::int32_t* ptr;

};
class C
{
public:
// Implementation
C(C const& oth) : x(oth.x)
{
// ...
x = x % 2; // Non-compliant - unrelated side-effect
}

private:
std::int32_t x;

};

class D
{
public:
explicit D(std::uint32_t a) : a(a), noOfModifications(0) {}
D(const D& d) : D(d.a) {} //compliant, not copying the debug information about number of
modifications
void SetA(std::uint32_t aa)
{
++noOfModifications;
a = aa;
}
std::uint32_t GetA() const noexcept
{
return a;
}

private:
std::uint32_t a;
std::uint64_t noOfModifications;
};

```

JSF December 2005 [8]: AV Rule 77: A copy constructor shall copy all data
members and bases that affect the class invariant (a data element representing
a cache, for example, would not need to be copied).
Rule A12-8-2 (advisory, implementation, automated) User-defined copy and
move assignment operators should use user-defined no-throw swap
function.

## Rationale

Using a non-throwing swap operation in the copy and move assignment operators
helps to achieve Strong Exception Safety. Each assignment operator is also
simplified because it does not require check for assignment to itself.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A12-8-2.cpp 289436 2017-10-04 10:45:23Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
#include <cstdint>
#include <utility>
class A
{
public:
A(const A& oth)
{
// ...
}
A(A&& oth) noexcept
{
// ...
}
A& operator=(const A& oth) & // Compliant
{
A tmp(oth);
Swap(*this, tmp);

return *this;
}
A& operator=(A&& oth) & noexcept // Compliant
{
A tmp(std::move(oth));

Swap(*this, tmp);

return *this;
}
static void Swap(A& lhs, A& rhs) noexcept
{
std::swap(lhs.ptr1, rhs.ptr1);
std::swap(lhs.ptr2, rhs.ptr2);
}

private:
std::int32_t* ptr1;

std::int32_t* ptr2;
};
class B
{
public:
B& operator=(const B& oth) & // Non-compliant
{
if (this != &oth)
{
ptr1
ptr2

= new std::int32_t(*oth.ptr1);
= new std::int32_t(

*oth.ptr2); // Exception thrown here results in

// a memory leak of ptr1

}

return *this;

}
B& operator=(B&& oth) & noexcept // Non-compliant
{
if (this != &oth)
{
ptr1 = std::move(oth.ptr1);
ptr2 = std::move(oth.ptr2);
oth.ptr1
= nullptr;
oth.ptr2
= nullptr;
}

return *this;

}

private:

std::int32_t* ptr1;

std::int32_t* ptr2;

};
