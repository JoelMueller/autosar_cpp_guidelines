> **Rule A16-2-3 (required, implementation, non-automated)**
>
> An include directive shall be added explicitly for every symbol used in a file.

## Rationale

All header files that define types or functions used in a file should be included
explicitly. The actual header to include depends on the specification of the
library/component used.

## Exception

Types defined via forward declarations do not violate this rule.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A16-2-3.hpp 319944 2018-05-21 09:00:40Z ilya.burylov $
#ifndef HEADER_HPP

#define HEADER_HPP

#include <array>
#include <cstdint>

class B; // Compliant - type B can be included using forward declaration

class OutOfRangeException
: public std::out_of_range // Non-compliant - <stdexcept> which defines
// out_of_range included
// implicitly through <array>
{
public:
using std::out_of_range::out_of_range;
};

class A
{
public:
// Interface of class A

private:
std::array<std::uint32_t, 10>
mArray; // Compliant - <array> included explicitly
B* mB;

std::int32_t mX; // Compliant - <cstdint> included explicitly
};

#endif

```
