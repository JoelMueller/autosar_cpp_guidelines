> Comments shall not document any actions or sources (e.g. tables,

## Rationale

Commenting only actions and sources that are inside a particular file reduce
dependencies among files. Comments in a file will require changes only when
content of the file reworked.
Note: This rule does not affect valid assumptions or preconditions for entities within
the file.
