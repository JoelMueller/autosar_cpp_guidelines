> **Rule M18-0-5 (required, implementation, automated)**
>
> The unbounded functions of library <cstring> shall not be used.
> See MISRA C++ 2008 [7]
> Note: The intention of this rule is to prohibit the functions from <cstring> which have a
> char* or char const* parameter, but no additional size_t parameter placing a bound
> on the underlying loop. Other functions from <cstring> taking a char _ or char const_
> parameter fall under the restrictions of rule A27-0-4. Use of memchr, memcmp,
> memset, memcpy, and memmove is still allowed by this rule, but limited by rule A120-2.
