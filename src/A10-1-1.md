## Rationale

Multiple inheritance exposes derived class to multiple implementations. This makes
the code more difficult to maintain.
See: Diamond-Problem, Interface-Class

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A10-1-1.cpp 289436 2017-10-04 10:45:23Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
#include <cstdint>
class A
{
public:
void F1() noexcept(false) {}

private:
std::int32_t x{0};
std::int32_t y{0};
};
class B
{
public:
void F2() noexcept(false) {}

private:

std::int32_t x{0};
};
class C : public A,
public B // Non-compliant - A and B are both not interface classes
{
};
class D
{
public:
virtual ~D() = 0;
virtual void F3() noexcept = 0;
virtual void F4() noexcept = 0;
};
class E
{
public:
static constexpr std::int32_t value{10};

virtual ~E() = 0;
virtual void F5() noexcept = 0;
};
class F : public A,
public B,
public D,
public E // Non-compliant - A and B are both not interface classes
{
};
class G : public A,
public D,
public E // Compliant - D and E are interface classes
{
};

```
