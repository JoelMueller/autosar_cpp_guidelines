> All memory shall be initialized before it is read.

## Rationale

Objects with automatic or dynamic storage duration are default-initialized if no
initializer is specified. Default initialization produces indeterminate values for objects
of neither class nor array types. Default initialization of array types leads to default
initialization of each array element. Reading from indeterminate values may produce
undefined behavior.
Thus, all local variables, member variables, or objects allocated dynamically must be
explicitly initialized before their values are read, unless they are of class type or array
of non-fundamental type. It is recommended practice to initialize all such objects
immediately when they are defined.
Note: Zero-initialization will happen before any other initialization for any objects with
static or thread-local storage duration. Thus, such objects need not be explicitly
initialized.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A8-5-0.cpp 307536 2018-02-14 12:35:11Z jan.babst $
#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

static std::int32_t zero; // Compliant - Variable with static storage duration
// is zero-initialized.

void local()
{
std::int32_t a;
// No initialization
std::int32_t b{}; // Compliant - zero initialization

b = a;
// Non-compliant - uninitialized memory read
a = zero; // Compliant - a is zero now
b = a;
// Compliant - read from initialized memory

std::string s; // Compliant - default constructor is a called
// read from s

}

void dynamic()
{
// Note: These examples violate A18-5-2

auto const a = new std::int32_t;
// No initialization
auto const b = new std::int32_t{}; // Compliant - zero initialization

*b = *a;

// Non-compliant - uninitialized memory read

*a = zero; // Compliant - a is zero now

*b = *a;

// Compliant - read from initialized memory

delete b;
delete a;

auto const s =
new std::string; // Compliant - default constructor is a called

// read from *s

delete s;

}

// Members of Bad are default-initialized by the (implicitly generated) default
// constructor. Note that this violates A12-1-1.
struct Bad
{
std::int32_t a;
std::int32_t b;
};

// Compliant - Members of Good are explicitly initialized.
// This also complies to A12-1-1.
struct Good
{
std::int32_t a{0};
std::int32_t b{0};
};

void members()
{
Bad bad; // Default constructor is called, but members a not initialized

bad.b = bad.a; // Non-compliant - uninitialized memory read
bad.a = zero;
// Compliant - bad.a is zero now
bad.b = bad.a; // Compliant - read from initialized memory

Good good; // Default constructor is called and initializes members

std::int32_t x = good.a; // Compliant

std::int32_t y = good.b; // Compliant

}

```
