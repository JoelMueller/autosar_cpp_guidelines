> **Rule A12-1-2 (required, implementation, automated)**
>
> Both NSDMI and a non-static member initializer in a constructor shall not
> be used in the same type.

## Rationale

Since 2011 C++ Language Standard it is allowed to initialize a non-static member
along with the declaration of the member in the class body using NSDMI (“non-static
data member initializer”). To avoid possible confusion which values are actually used,

if any member is initialized by NSDMI or with a constructor, then all others should be
initialized the same way.

## Exception

The move and copy constructors are exempt from this rule, because these
constructors copy the existing values from other objects.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A12-1-2.cpp 271696 2017-03-23 09:23:09Z piotr.tanski $
#include <cstdint>
#include <utility>
class A
{
public:
A() : i1{0}, i2{0} // Compliant - i1 and i2 are initialized by the
// constructor only. Not compliant with A12-1-3
{
}
// Implementation

private:
std::int32_t i1;
std::int32_t i2;
};
class B
{
public:
// Implementation

private:
std::int32_t i1{0};
std::int32_t i2{
0}; // Compliant - both i1 and i2 are initialized by NSDMI only
};
class C
{
public:
C() : i2{0} // Non-compliant - i1 is initialized by NSDMI, i2 is in
// member in member initializer list
{
}
C(C const& oth) : i1{oth.i1}, i2{oth.i2} // Compliant by exception
{
}
C(C&& oth)
: i1{std::move(oth.i1)},
i2{std::move(oth.i2)} // Compliant by exception
{
}
// Implementation

private:
std::int32_t i1{0};
std::int32_t i2;

};

```
