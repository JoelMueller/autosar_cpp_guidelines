## Rationale

Reimplementing constructors that do not need further initialization is error-prone and
may lead to using wrong base class constructor accidentally.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A12-1-6.cpp 289436 2017-10-04 10:45:23Z michal.szczepankiewicz $

#include <cstdint>

class A
{
public:
A(std::int32_t x, std::int32_t y) : x(x + 8), y(y) {}

explicit A(std::int32_t x) : A(x, 0) {}

private:
std::int32_t x;
std::int32_t y;

};

// Non-compliant
class B : public A
{
public:
B(std::int32_t x, std::int32_t y) : A(x, y) {}
explicit B(std::int32_t x) : A(x) {}
};

// Compliant
class C : public A
{
public:
using A::A;
};

```
