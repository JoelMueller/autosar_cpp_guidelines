## Rationale

Functions which are not callable from outside the compilation unit in which they are
defined, or from outside the class implementation to which they pertain, and which
are not used may be symptomatic of serious problems, such as poor software design
or missing paths in flow control.
This rule enforces developers to statically and explicitly use every such function in
the source code. A function does not necessarily need to be called at run-time. Rule
M0-1-1 detects all unreachable code occurrences.
Note that this rule applies equally to static and non-static private member functions.

## Example

```cpp
//% $Id: A0-1-3.cpp 291350 2017-10-17 14:31:34Z jan.babst $
#include <cstdint>
static void F1() // Compliant
{
}

namespace
{
void F2() // Non-compliant, defined function never used
{
}
}

class C
{
public:
C() : x(0) {}
void M1(std::int32_t i) // Compliant, member function is used
{
x = i;
}

void M2(std::int32_t i,
std::int32_t j) // Compliant, never used but declared
// as public
{
x = (i > j) ? i : j;
}

protected:
void M1ProtectedImpl(std::int32_t j) // Compliant, never used but declared
// as protected
{
x = j;
}

private:
std::int32_t x;
void M1PrivateImpl(
std::int32_t j) // Non-compliant, private member function never used
{
x = j;
}

};

int main(int, char**)

{
F1();
C c;
c.M1(1);
return 0;

}

```
