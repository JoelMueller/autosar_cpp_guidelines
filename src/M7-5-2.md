> **Rule M7-5-2 (required, implementation, non-automated)**
>
> The address of an object with automatic storage shall not be assigned to
> another object that may persist after the first object has ceased to exist.
> See MISRA C++ 2008 [7]
> Note: C++ specifies that binding a temporary object (e.g. automatic variable returned
> from a function) to a reference to const prolongs the lifetime of the temporary to the
> lifetime of the reference.
> Note: Rule 7-5-2 concerns C++11 smart pointers, i.e. std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr
> and std::weak_ptr, too.
