## Rationale

Naming an implementation file with a name of a declared type or accordingly to a
collection of free functions makes a project structure more clear and readable.

JSF December 2005 [8]: AV Rule 56: The name of an implementation file
should reflect the logical entity for which it provides definitions and have a
“.cpp” extension (this name will normally be identical to the header file that
provides the corresponding declarations.).
