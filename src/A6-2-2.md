## Rationale

The developer’s intention might have been to define an unnamed local variable that
would live until the end of the scope to implement the RAII pattern (Resource
Acquisition Is Initialization). But as there are no unnamed variables in C++, it is in fact
only creating a temporary object that gets destroyed again at the end of the full
expression.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A6-2-2.cpp 326655 2018-07-20 14:58:55Z christof.meerwald $

#include <cstdint>
#include <fstream>
#include <mutex>

class A
{
public:
void SetValue1(std::int32_t value)
{
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> {m_mtx}; // Non-compliant: temporary object
// Assignment to m_value is not protected by lock
m_value = value;
}

void SetValue2(std::int32_t value)
{
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard{m_mtx}; // Compliant: local variable m_value = value;

}

private:
mutable std::mutex m_mtx;
std::int32_t m_value;
};

void Print(std::string const & fname, std::string const & s)
{
// Compliant: Not only constructing a temporary object
std::ofstream{fname}.write(s.c_str(), s.length());
}

```
