> Do statements should not be used.

## Rationale

Do-statements are bug-prone, as the termination condition is checked at the end and
can be overlooked.

## Exception

A do-statement may be used in a function-like macro to ensure that its invocation
behaves like an expression statement consisting of a function call (see http://cfaq.com/cpp/multistmt.html).
Note: Rule A16-0-1 forbids function-like macros. This exception is kept in case rule
A16-0-1 is disabled in a project.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A6-5-3.cpp 291350 2017-10-17 14:31:34Z jan.babst $

#include <cstdint>

// Compliant by exception
#define SWAP(a, b)
\
do
\
{
\
decltype(a) tmp = (a); \
(a) = (b);
\
(b) = tmp;
\
} while (0)

// Non-compliant
#define SWAP2(a, b)
decltype(a) tmp = (a); \
(a) = (b);
(b) = tmp;

\
\

int main(void)
{
uint8_t a = 24;
uint8_t b = 12;

if (a > 12)
SWAP(a, b);

// if (a > 12)
//SWAP2(a, b);
// Does not compile, because only the first line is used in the body of the
// if-statement. In other cases this may even cause a run-time error.
// The expansion contain two semicolons in a row, which may be flagged by
// compiler warnings.

// Expands to:
// if (a > 12)
//decltype(a) tmp = (a);
// (a) = (b);
// (b) = tmp;;

return 0;

}

```

C++ Core Guidelines [11]: ES.75: Avoid do-statements.
Rule A6-5-4 (advisory, implementation, automated) For-init-statement
and expression should not perform actions other than loop-counter
initialization and modification.

## Rationale

If only a loop-counter is used in the for-init-statement and expression, it increases
readability and it is easier to understand and maintain code.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A6-5-4.cpp 305629 2018-01-29 13:29:25Z piotr.serwa $
#include <cstdint>

void Fn() noexcept
{
for (std::int32_t x = 0, MAX=10; x < MAX; x++) // compliant with A6-5-2, but
non-compliant with advisory A6-5-4
{
// ...
}
}

```
