## Rationale

Since C++14 Language Standard it is allowed to overload both sized and unsized
versions of the “delete” operator. Sized version provides more efficient way of
memory deallocation than the unsized one, especially when the allocator allocates in
size categories instead of storing the size nearby the object.

## Example

```cpp
//% $Id: A18-5-4.cpp 289415 2017-10-04 09:10:20Z piotr.serwa $
#include <cstdlib>
void operator delete(
void* ptr) noexcept // Compliant - sized version is defined

{
std::free(ptr);
}
void operator delete(
void* ptr,

std::size_t size) noexcept // Compliant - unsized version is defined
{
std::free(ptr);
}

```
