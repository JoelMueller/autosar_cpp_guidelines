## Rationale

A for loop without a loop-counter is simply a while loop. If this is the desired behavior,
then a while loop is more appropriate.
Floating types, as they should not be tested for equality/inequality, are not to be used
as loop-counters.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A6-5-2.cpp 289436 2017-10-04 10:45:23Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
#include <cstdint>
namespace
{
constexpr std::int32_t xlimit = 20;
constexpr std::int32_t ylimit = 15;
constexpr float zlimit = 2.5F;
constexpr std::int32_t ilimit = 100;
}
void Fn() noexcept
{
std::int32_t y = 0;

for (std::int32_t x = 0; x < xlimit && y < ylimit;
x++, y++) // Non-compliant, two loop-counters
{
// ...
}

for (float z = 0.0F; z != zlimit;
z += 0.1F) // Non-compliant, float with !=
{
// ...
}

for (float z = 0.0F; z < zlimit; z += 0.1F) // Non-compliant, float with <
{
// ...
}

for (std::int32_t i = 0; i < ilimit; ++i) // Compliant
{
// ...
}

}

```
