> A smart pointer shall only be used as a parameter type if it

## Rationale

If the object passed into the function is merely used without affecting the lifetime, it is
preferable to pass it by reference or raw pointer instead.
Keeping a copy of a std::shared_ptr or moving a std::unique_ptr would be examples
that affect the lifetime.
Note: When an object whose lifetime is managed by a non-local smart pointer is
passed by reference or raw pointer, care needs to be taken that the lifetime of the
object doesnâ€™t end during the duration of the called function. In the case of a
std::shared_ptr this can be achieved by keeping a local copy of the shared_ptr.

## Exception

A non-owning smart pointer, like std::observer_ptr from the C++ Library
Fundamentals TS v2, that documents the non-owning property of the parameter does
not violate this rule.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A8-4-11.cpp 307966 2018-02-16 16:03:46Z christof.meerwald $

#include <cstdint>
#include <memory>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>

class A
{
public:
void do_stuff();
};

// Non-Compliant: passing object as smart pointer
void foo(std::shared_ptr<A> a)
{
if (a)
{
a->do_stuff();
}
else
{
// ...
}
}

// Compliant: passing as raw pointer instead

void bar(A *a)

{
if (a != nullptr)
{
a->do_stuff();
}
else
{
// ...
}

}

class B
{
public:
void add_a(std::shared_ptr<A> a)
{
m_v.push_back(a);
}

private:
std::vector<std::shared_ptr<A>> m_v;

};

// Compliant: storing the shared pointer (affecting lifetime)
void bar(B &b, std::shared_ptr<A> a)
{
b.add_a(a);
}

```
