> Bitwise operations and operations that assume data representation
> in memory shall not be performed on objects.

## Rationale

Object representations may consist of more than only the declared fields (unless the
objects are standard-layout or trivially copyable). Performing bitwise operations on
objects may access bits that are not part of the value representation, which may lead
to undefined behavior. Operations on objects (e.g. initialization, copying, comparing,
setting, accessing) shall be done by dedicated constructors, overloaded operators,
accessors or mutators.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A12-0-2.cpp 305629 2018-01-29 13:29:25Z piotr.serwa $

//
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>

class A
{
public:
A() = default;
A(uint8_t c, uint32_t i, int8_t d, int32_t h) : c(c), i(i), d(d), h(h) {}

bool operator==(const A& rhs) const noexcept
{
return c==rhs.c && i==rhs.i && d==rhs.d && h==rhs.h;
}

private:
uint8_t c;
uint32_t i;
int8_t d;
int32_t h;
};

int main(void)
{
A noninit;

//setting field c
std::memset(&noninit, 3, 1); //non-compliant
//setting field i

std::memset(((uint8_t*)&noninit)+sizeof(uint8_t)+3, 5, 1); //non-compliant

A init(3, 5, 7, 9); //compliant

if (noninit == init) //compliant
{

}

if (0 == std::memcmp(&noninit, &init, sizeof(init)))
{ //non-compliant, includes padding bytes

}

return 0;

}

```
