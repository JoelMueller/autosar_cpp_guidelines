> An already-owned pointer value shall not be stored in an unrelated
> smart pointer.

## Rationale

Smart pointers (e.g. std::shared_ptr) that allow to manage the same underlying pointer
value using multiple smart pointer objects, shall be created in a way that creates a
relationship between two smart pointer objects (e.g. via copy assignment). Unrelated
smart pointer objects with a pointer value that is owned by another smart pointer
object shall not be created.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A20-8-1.cpp 305588 2018-01-29 11:07:35Z michal.szczepankiewicz $

#include <memory>

void Foo()
{
uint32_t *i = new uint32_t{5};

std::shared_ptr<uint32_t> p1(i);
std::shared_ptr<uint32_t> p2(i); // non-compliant
}

void Bar()
{
std::shared_ptr<uint32_t> p1 = std::make_shared<uint32_t>(5);
std::shared_ptr<uint32_t> p2(p1); //compliant
}

```
