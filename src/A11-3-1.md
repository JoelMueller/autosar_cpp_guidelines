> **Rule A11-3-1 (required, implementation, automated)**
>
> Friend declarations shall not be used.

## Rationale

Friend declarations reduce encapsulation and result in code that is more difficult to
maintain.

## Exception

It is allowed to declare comparison operators as friend functions, see A13-5-5.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A11-3-1.cpp 325916 2018-07-13 12:26:22Z christof.meerwald $
class A
{
public:
A& operator+=(A const& oth);
friend A const operator+(A const& lhs, A const& rhs); // Non-compliant
};
class B
{
public:
B& operator+=(B const& oth);
friend bool operator ==(B const& lhs, B const& rhs) // Compliant by exception
{

// Implementation

}

};

B const operator+(B const& lhs, B const& rhs) // Compliant
{
// Implementation
}

```

function or object requires access to the private elements of the class, but is
unable to be a member of the class for logical or efficiency reasons.
