## Rationale

If an object is supposed to be destroyed through a pointer or reference to its base
class, the destructor in the base class needs to be virtual. Otherwise, destructors for
derived types will not be invoked.
Note that if it is prohibited to destroy an object through a pointer or reference to its
base class, the destructor in the base class is supposed to be protected.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A12-4-1.cpp 289436 2017-10-04 10:45:23Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
class A
{
public:
~A() // Non-compliant

{
}

};
class B : public A
{
};
class C
{
public:
virtual ~C() // Compliant
{
}
};
class D : public C
{
};
class E
{
protected:
~E(); // Compliant
};
class F : public E
{
};

void F1(A* obj1, C* obj2)

{
// ...
delete obj1; // Only destructor of class A will be invoked
delete obj2; // Both destructors of D and C will be invoked

}
void F2()
{

A* a = new B;

C* c = new D;

F1(a, c);

}

```
