> There should be no unused type declarations.

## Rationale

Unused type declarations make code unnecessary more complex and complicate
review process. Unused types can be redundant or be unused by mistake.
Note: Libraries development require introduction new types not used internally.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A0-1-6.cpp$
#include <cstdint>

std::uint32_t Fn() noexcept
{
using LocalUIntPtr = std::uint32_t*;

return 0U;

}

```
