## Rationale

If compiler enables the high warning level, then it is able to generate useful warning
messages that point out potential run-time problems during compilation time. The
information can be used to resolve certain errors before they occur at run-time.
Note that it is common practice to turn warnings into errors.
Also, note that enabling the highest compiler warning level may produce numerous
useless messages during compile time. It is important that the valid warning level for
the specific compiler is established in the project.
