## Rationale

The current version of the C++ language is as defined by the ISO International
Standard ISO/IEC 14822:2014(E) "Information technology - Programming languages

- C++".
  The C++14 is the improved version of the C++11. It is also “the state of the art” of
  C++ development that is required by ISO 26262 standard [6].
  Any reference in this document to “C++ Language Standard” refers to the ISO/IEC
  Note that all of the deprecated features of C++ Language Standard are defined in
  ISO/IEC 14882:2014 - Programming Language C++ Annexes C “Compatibility” and
  D “Compatibility features”.

## Example

```cpp
//% $Id: A1-1-1.cpp 289436 2017-10-04 10:45:23Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
#include <cstdint>
#include <stdexcept>
void F(std::int32_t i)
{
std::int32_t* a = nullptr;

// __try // Non-compliant - __try is a part of Visual Studio extension
try // Compliant - try keyword is a part of C++ Language Standard
{
a = new std::int32_t[i];
// ...
}

// __finally // Non-compliant - __finally is a part of Visual Studio
// extension
catch (
std::exception&) // Compliant - C++ Language Standard does not define
// finally block, only try and catch blocks
{
delete[] a;
a = nullptr;
}

}

```
