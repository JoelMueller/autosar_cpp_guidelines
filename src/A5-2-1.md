## Rationale

Implementations of dynamic_cast mechanism are unsuitable for use with real-time
systems where low memory usage and determined performance are essential.
If dynamic casting is essential for your program, usage of its custom implementation
should be considered. Also, usage of the dynamic_cast can be replaced with
polymorphism, i.e. virtual functions.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A5-2-1.cpp 289436 2017-10-04 10:45:23Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
class A
{
public:
virtual void F() noexcept;
};
class B : public A
{
public:
void F() noexcept override {}
};

void Fn(A* aptr) noexcept

{

// ...

B* bptr = dynamic_cast<B*>(aptr); // Non-compliant

if (bptr != nullptr)
{
// Use B class interface
}
else
{
// Use A class interface
}

}

```

simple cases); Use of the visitor (or similar) pattern (most likely useful in
complicated cases).
