> Hexadecimal constants should be upper case.

## Rationale

Using upper case literals for hexadecimal constants makes the source code
consistent in this matter and removes a potential developer confusion.

## Example

```cpp
//% $Id: A2-13-5.cpp 305629 2018-01-29 13:29:25Z piotr.serwa $

#include <cstdint>

int main(void)
{
std::int16_t a = 0x0f0f; //non-compliant
std::int16_t b = 0x0f0F; //non-compliant
std::int16_t c = 0x0F0F; //compliant

return 0;

}

```
