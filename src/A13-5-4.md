## Rationale

Defining one operator in terms of the other simplifies maintenance and prevents from
accidental errors during code development.
Note: Completeness of relational operators can be achieved by implementing just
operator== and operator< and using namespace rel_ops.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A13-5-4.cpp 328319 2018-08-03 14:08:42Z christof.meerwald $
#include <cstdint>

// non-compliant
class A
{
public:
explicit A(std::uint32_t d) : d(d) {}

friend bool operator==(A const & lhs, A const & rhs) noexcept
{
return lhs.d == rhs.d;
}
friend bool operator!=(A const & lhs, A const & rhs) noexcept
{
return lhs.d != rhs.d;
}

private:
std::uint32_t d;
};

// compliant
class B
{
public:
explicit B(std::uint32_t d) : d(d) {}

friend bool operator==(B const & lhs, B const & rhs) noexcept
{
return lhs.d == rhs.d;
}

friend bool operator!=(B const & lhs, B const & rhs) noexcept
{
return !(lhs == rhs);

}
private:
std::uint32_t d;
};

```
