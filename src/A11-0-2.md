## Rationale

This is consistent with developer expectations that a class provides its invariant,
interface and encapsulation guarantee, while a struct is only an aggregate without
any class-like features.
An example of a struct type is POD type.
See: POD-type.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A11-0-2.cpp 289436 2017-10-04 10:45:23Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
#include <cstdint>
struct A // Compliant
{
std::int32_t x;
double y;
};
struct B // Compliant
{
std::uint8_t x;
A a;
};
struct C // Compliant
{
float x = 0.0f;
std::int32_t y = 0;
std::uint8_t z = 0U;
};
struct D // Non-compliant
{
public:
std::int32_t x;

protected:
std::int32_t y;

private:

std::int32_t z;
};
struct E // Non-compliant
{
public:
std::int32_t x;
void Fn() noexcept {}

private:
void F1() noexcept(false) {}
};
struct F : public D // Non-compliant
{
};

```
