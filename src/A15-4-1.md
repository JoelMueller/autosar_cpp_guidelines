> Dynamic exception-specification shall not be used.

## Rationale

This feature was deprecated in the 2011 C++ Language Standard (See: Deprecating
Exception Specifications).
Main issues with dynamic exception specifications are:
Run-time checking: Exception specifications are checked at runtime, so the
program does not guarantee that all exceptions will be handled. The run-time
failure mode does not lend itself to recovery.
Run-time overhead: Run-time checking requires the compiler to produce additional
code that hampers optimizations.
Unusable in generic code: It is not possible to know what types of exceptions may
be thrown from templates arguments operations, so a precise exception
specification cannot be written.
In place of dynamic exception-specification, use noexcept specification that allows to
declare whether a function throws or does not throw exceptions.
Note: std::unexpected_handler shall not be used.

## Example

```cpp
//% $Id: A15-4-1.cpp 289436 2017-10-04 10:45:23Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
#include <stdexcept>
void F1() noexcept; // Compliant - note that noexcept is the same as
// noexcept(true)
void F2() throw();
// Non-compliant - dynamic exception-specification is
// deprecated
void F3() noexcept(false);
// Compliant
void F4() throw(std::runtime_error); // Non-compliant - dynamic
// exception-specification is deprecated
void F5() throw(
...); // Non-compliant - dynamic exception-specification is deprecated
template <class T>
void F6() noexcept(noexcept(T())); // Compliant

```
