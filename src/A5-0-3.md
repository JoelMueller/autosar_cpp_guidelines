## Rationale

Use of more than two levels of indirection can seriously impair the ability to
understand the behavior of the code, and therefore should be avoided.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A5-0-3.cpp 289436 2017-10-04 10:45:23Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
#include <cstdint>

using IntPtr = std::int8_t*;

struct S
{

std::int8_t* s1;

std::int8_t** s2;

// Compliant
// Compliant

std::int8_t*** s3;

// Non-compliant

};

S* ps1;

// Compliant

S** ps2;

// Compliant

S*** ps3; // Non-compliant

std::int8_t**

(*pfunc1)();

// Compliant

std::int8_t**

(**pfunc2)();

// Compliant

std::int8_t** (***pfunc3)(); // Non-compliant

std::int8_t*** (**pfunc4)(); // Non-compliant

void Fn(std::int8_t* par1,
std::int8_t** par2,

// Compliant
// Compliant

critical and safety-related systems

std::int8_t*** par3,

// Non-compliant

IntPtr* par4,

IntPtr* const* const par5,

std::int8_t* par6[],

// Compliant
// Non-compliant
// Compliant

std::int8_t** par7[])

// Non-compliant

{

std::int8_t* ptr1;

std::int8_t** ptr2;

std::int8_t*** ptr3;

IntPtr* ptr4;

IntPtr* const* const ptr5 = nullptr;

std::int8_t* ptr6[10];

// Compliant
// Compliant
// Non-compliant
// Compliant
// Non-compliant
// Compliant

std::int8_t** ptr7[10];

// Compliant

}

// Explanation of types
// 1) par1 and ptr1 are of type pointer to std::int8_t.
// 2) par2 and ptr2 are of type pointer to pointer to std::int8_t.
// 3) par3 and ptr3 are of type pointer to a pointer to a pointer
// to std::int8_t.
// This is three levels and is non-compliant.
// 4) par4 and ptr4 are expanded to a type of pointer to a pointer to
// std::int8_t.
// 5) par5 and ptr5 are expanded to a type of const pointer to a const
// pointer
// to a pointer to std::int8_t. This is three levels and is non-compliant.
// 6) par6 is of type pointer to pointer to std::int8_t because arrays
// are converted
// to a pointer to the initial element of the array.
// 7) ptr6 is of type pointer to array of std::int8_t.
// 8) par7 is of type pointer to pointer to pointer to
// std::int8_t because arrays are
// converted to a pointer to the initial element of the array. This is
// three
// levels and is non-compliant.
// 9) ptr7 is of type array of pointer to pointer to std::int8_t. This
// is compliant.
