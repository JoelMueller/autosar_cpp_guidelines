> **Rule A1-4-3 (advisory, implementation, automated)**

> All code should compile free of compiler warnings.

## Rationale

Compiler warnings provide the earliest tool-supported indication of potential problems
in source code. Developers should not ignore compiler warnings.
Note: Compiler warnings should be turned on to a level matching (as far as possible)
the rules in this document, in particular A1-1-1. A possible enforcement of this rule is
to turn compiler warnings into errors.
