## Rationale

An execution boundary is the delimitation between code compiled by differing
compilers, including different versions of a compiler produced by the same vendor.
For instance, a function may be declared in a header file but defined in a library that
is loaded at runtime. The execution boundary is between the call site in the
executable and the function implementation in the library. Such boundaries are also
called ABI (application binary interface) boundaries because they relate to the
interoperability of application binaries.
Throwing an exception across an execution boundary requires that both sides of the
execution boundary use the same ABI for exception handling, which may be difficult
to ensure.

## Exception

If it can be ensured that the execution boundaries use the same ABI for exception
handling routines on both sides, then throwing an exception across these execution
boundaries is allowed.
